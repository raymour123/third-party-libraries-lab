RXJava appears to be a more efficient and less verbose way to create code that runs on various threads. It is reactive code that uses "observables" and "subscribers"... It is something that I would use to replace traditional code that was being run as an AsyncTask.

## Introduction


In this lab, you will be experimenting with a third party library of your choice from the list provided below. This will give you extra practice on how to read the documentation for libraries, understand what they do, and actually using them. There are many libraries out there, but this list includes some popular ones that accomplish a variety of different tasks.

The lab will be broken down into two sections:

1. Briefly go through the libraries listed below. Then choose one you want to use, and create a document that explains **in your own words** what the library does. Additionally, give an example of how the library might be used in an app.
2. Create an app that uses the library you chose. It's up to you to decide what the app does, the only requirement is that you use one of the libraries. If an example is given in the documentation, don't just copy that into your app!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create a document that includes:
  - An explanation of the purpose of your library
  - An example of how you might use it
- An app that uses the library you chose

#### Deliverable

- A document meeting the above requirements
- An app that uses your library
